### Notes

- Problem of propositional attitude aggregation in generality e.g. preference, [[Aggregating sets of judgements-An impossibility result|judgement]], or probabilistic.
- Kinds of propositional attitudes characterized by two dimensions:
	1. **Role** within agent's rational performance e.g. belief-like or desire-like as in Humean picture of rational agency
	2. Formal **structure**: e.g. binary or degrees 

>[!info] Theorem
> An aggregation rule satisfies universal domain, collective rationality, independence and implication preservation if and only if it is linear.

When aggregating subjective probabilities linear aggregation rules are just weighted average of individual probabilities where the weights sum to 1. While, linear judgment and preference aggregation rules are [[Arrow’s theorem in judgment aggregation|dictatorial]] where the weights are binary, moreover, the weight is 1 for just one individual and 0 for the remaining.
