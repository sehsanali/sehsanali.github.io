### Notes

This paper proceeds by claiming that DM's _desire to randomize_[^1] is an additional cause of [[Stochastic Choice and Consideration Sets|stochastic choice]] besides the two most common approaches taken explaining stochastic behavior, i.e.
1. Stochastic preferences
2. Stochastic mistakes but stable preferences

And then enumerates recent evidence for this deliberate randomization from various experimental approaches e.g. Consecutive repeated choices, convex budget sets, field evidence among other related studies. 

- "Evidence of randomization can be seen as evidence of incompleteness."
- Agents deliberately randomizing *violate* choices maximizing complete, monotone preferences following EU.

[^1]: E.g. They maybe unsure or have strict preferences for mixtures  (Machina 1985)
