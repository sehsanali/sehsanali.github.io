### Notes
- Judgment is binary on propositions $\phi$ in the agenda $X$.
- Rationality constraints on the set of judgements (personal or collective) $\Phi \subseteq X$:
	- Completeness: $\forall \phi \in X  \Rightarrow (\phi \in \Phi) \vee (\neg \phi \in \Phi)$
	- Consistency: $\nexists \phi \in \Phi$ such that $(\phi \in \Phi) \wedge (\neg \phi \in \Phi)$ 
	- Deductive closure: $\forall \phi \in \Phi$, if $\phi \Rightarrow \psi \in X$ then $\psi \in \Phi$
- Judgement aggregation function $F: \mathcal{P}(X^n) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)$ maps profile of personal judgements $\{ \Phi_i \}_{i \in N}$, where $\Phi_i \subseteq X$, to a collective set of judgements $\Phi \subseteq X$. 
	- If domain is all possible profiles of complete, consistent and deductively closed personal set of judgements then $F$ satisfies Universal Domain.
	- If $F$ is unique up-to permutations of personal sets of judgements $\Phi_i$ then it satisfies Anonymity.
	- If $F$ treats all propositions in an even-handed way (i.e. independence and neutrality of individual judgements) then it satisfies Systematicity.


>[!info] Impossibility result
> Under the minimal assumptions of Universal Domain, Anonymity and Systematicity there does not exist a judgement aggregation function which is complete, consistent and deductively closed.

Importantly, [[Arrowâ€™s theorem in judgment aggregation|Arrow's impossibility theorem]] can be seen as a special case of judgement impossibility result when preferences are expressed as propositions of the form: $x$ is preferable to $y$. There are attempts at generalizing [[The aggregation of propositional attitudes-towards a general theory|aggregation of various propositional attitudes]] (e.g preferences, judgement, [[Opinion pooling on general agendas|probabilistic aggregation]]) in a unified framework.
