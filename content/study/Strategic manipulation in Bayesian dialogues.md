### Notes
Bayesian dialogue is a form of _indirect communication_ where two individuals take turns to publicly announce their Bayesian updated posteriors about a certain event. It is classically known from **_Aumann's agreement result_**[^1] that if it is common knowledge amongst two individuals that they have **common prior** and their **informational partition of the state space** is common knowledge too, then they necessarily agree on posterior probabilities assigned to an event. It is a static result which was later proved to hold in the dynamic[^2] setting of Bayesian dialogues assuming that the individuals always truthfully announce their posteriors which eventually converge. With a careful analysis of some curated examples, in this paper, it is brought to attention that in a Bayesian dialogue:
- There could be several subsets of state space that could satisfy conditions of Aumann's agreement result.
- Moreover, the order of who starts the Bayesian dialogue first matters in determining which subset of state space is reached eventually. 
- There is room for strategic manipulability by not truthfully announcing posteriors, even with coinciding interests, so that in game theoretic situation a more strategically stable equilibrium is reached (Sec 4).
