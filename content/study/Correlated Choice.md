### Notes
Extending degenerate _[[Stochastic Choice and Consideration Sets|stochastic choice]]_ rules to _random joint choice rule_ is warranted in order to study stochastic choice data from situations such as
 - There are multiple agents whose choices could be interdependent e.g. spouses
 - An individual/population making repeated choices

The motivation of this paper is a 'latent variable story' i.e. multiple DMs may condition their choices based on some latent variable which is unobserved in the data, and by virtue of which the choice data is stochastic. The idea of the paper is that if the *"unobserved component conditional on which joint choice is **separable**[^1], then each individual must have a well-defined random choice rule defined via marginal distributions"*. 

The paper provides axioms under which random joint choice rules satisfy **marginality**[^2], which is a necessary condition for **stochastic separability**[^3].

[^1]:  It is a normative criterion reflecting that individual choices are independent of each other, formally $c(A,B)$ is separable if $\exists c_1(A),c_2(B)$ such that  $c(A,B)= (c_1(A),c_2(B))$.
[^2]: Marginality defined as the probability of choosing some $x$ from choice set $A$ of an agent is independent of others' choice set. Marginality lays out the _latent variable story_ by providing a minimal normative criterion in the absence of direct influence on choices e.g. peer effects. 
[^3]: "Stochastic separability is the requirement that there is some latent variable governing joint choice behavior, but that conditional on this variable, choice is separable."
