### Notes

- Why behavioral biases persist even when there's direct feedback? e.g. base-rate neglect
	- Confidence in misspecified mental model $\rightarrow$ sluggish response/inattentiveness to information (Esponda et al. \[2022\])
	- Learning in one environment may not _transfer_ to another (subject of this paper)

Using lab data from Esponda et al. \[2022\], the authors conjecture in this paper that individuals engage in unsophisticated forms of learning whereby they simply learn what works best for a particular situation, environment, or parametrization of a game. A sizeable fraction of individuals do not take learning from a repeated(learned) game with feedback over to another similar game but with different parametrization. 


>ðŸ’¡ If individuals were aware of playing a similar game(with different parameters) after the repeated game then they would have perhaps paid more attention to learning heuristics of the game being played. Why and how?
