### Notes

- Main question is to investigate aggregation of different propositional attitudes in generality e.g. [[Arrow’s theorem in judgment aggregation|preference]], [[Aggregating sets of judgements-An impossibility result|judgement]], or [[Opinion pooling on general agendas|probabilistic]].
- Propositional attitudes are characterized by two dimensions:
	1. **Role** within agent's rational performance e.g. belief-like or desire-like as in Humean picture of rational agency
	2. Formal **structure**: e.g. binary or degrees 

>[!info] Theorem
> An aggregation rule satisfies universal domain, collective rationality, independence and implication preservation if and only if it is linear.

When aggregating subjective probabilities, linear aggregation rules are just weighted average of individual probabilities where the weights sum to 1. While, linear aggregation rules in the framework of judgments and preferences are dictatorial where the weights are binary, moreover, the weight is 1 for just one individual and 0 for the remaining.
