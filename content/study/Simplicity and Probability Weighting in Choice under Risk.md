### Notes
Situates a hybrid of *Simplicity theory* and *Cumulative Prospect theory* in the evidence of empirical regularities: **certainty effect** and **complexity aversion**. Demonstrates by application that CPT-Simplicity[^1] predicts sharply choice under risk in contrast to existing models. 


[^1]: Hybrid model of Cumulative Prospect Theory and Simplicity Theory-- combining weighting probabilities with complexity cost which is increasing in the size of support of a lottery $p$.
$$u(p) = \sum u(x_i) \left[ \pi\left( \sum_{k=1}^i p_{k} \right) -\pi\left(  \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} p_{k} \right)  \right] - C(|\text{supp}(p)|)$$
