### Notes
Strict preferences are represented by using predicate logic, which allows preferences to embed preference aggregation in the formal logical model of [[Aggregating sets of judgements-An impossibility result|judgement aggregation]] e.g. if for an individual $x \succ y$ then her truth value of judgement for the proposition $xPy$ is true in the judgement aggregation model. (Reverse embedding or its non-existence has not been achieved)
- See Table 2 for a summary of corresponding concepts between preferences and judgements.

As a consequence, under some assumptions of logical connectedness, Arrow's impossibility result for strict preference aggregation follows(Corollary 1) from the impossibility result of judgement aggregation(Theorem 2).
