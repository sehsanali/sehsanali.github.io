Robert J. Aumann

### Notes
Aumann attempts to reconcile the game theoretical and mainstream economics' paradigm of _rationality_ with _systematic irrationality_ in behavioral economics substantiated mostly from from lab experiments by proposing **_rule-rationality_** as the synthesis following Hegel's dialectical triad--considering the former two as thesis and antithesis respectively. 

From the lens of _rule-rationality_--which are rules plausibly evolved culturally or genetically and decision makers act according to them--both mainstream and behavioral economics complement each other rather than oppose and may not work in contrived situations. The paper's main argument is captured in figure below, that is, rules of thumbs/biases/heuristics ... in behavioral economics and the classical rational behavior (termed _**act-rational**_) can be thought of as acting by rules that are aimed at utility maximization which do not work in unusual scenarios.
