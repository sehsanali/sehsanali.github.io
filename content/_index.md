Hi, I am Ehsan. A PhD candidate in Economics at [Ca'Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/). This is an attempt at creating a digital knowledge-base of my [[Research/index|ruminations]] and [[Study/index|learnings]] as I traverse some streams in the vast body of Economic literature. 



You can reach out to me at syedehsan.ali\[at\]unive.it.
